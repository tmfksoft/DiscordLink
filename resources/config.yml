# Guild and Channel configuration
# You can have as many guilds and channels as you want.
# The bot MUST be added to the specific guilds for it to work though.
# The guilds and channels are defined by their ID's (Right click "Copy ID" in Discord)
# You can enable or disable a guild without removing it from the configuration entirely
# A channel can be set to send messages or not and recieve messages or not.
# You may wish to have a one way staff channel relay. You'd send recieve to false and send to true.
# A channel can also take a webhook (optional), when a webhook is set for a channel messages from Minecraft
# will be sent via that webhook with the players username and message.
# Webhook messages DO NOT use the send format.
# A channel also may posses 'options' this can be accessed by plugins integrating with DiscordLink
# to get channel specific settings.
